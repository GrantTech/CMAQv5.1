# CMAQv5.1
CMAQ v5.1 + IOAPI v3.2 in a container, ready to follow tutorials or quick-test the application

Due to the comlexity of compiling CMAQ and all the requirements (IOAPI, netCDF...), we decided to create this recipe for a Docker container. It is still work in progress and there may be better ways to accomplish the same task, but this one has been verified and is can run the tutorials.
